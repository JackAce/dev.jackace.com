title: Million Dollar Blackjack - JackAce Book Review

<p>
    <i>Million Dollar Blackjack</i> by Ken Uston is a great look into Blackjack in the 1980's,
    where playboy Ken Uston used wacky disguises to beat the casinos for Millions.

    I believe Ken Uston is one of the most interesting Blackjack players to ever play the game.
    He is responsible for Atlantic City not being able to bar card counters from playing. He was
    a brilliant man who also mastered computer games like Pac-Man. He even wrote a book on speed
    cubing for the Rubik's Cube.
