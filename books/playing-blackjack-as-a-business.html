title: Playing Blackjack as a Business - JackAce Book Review
---

<p>
    Lawrence Revere (a.k.a Spec Parsons) revolutionized Blackjack with his simplified
    "Plus-Minus" count, the predecessor to the widely used "Hi Low" count used today.
</p>
<p>
    Revere also created the first color Blackjack Basic Strategy charts, whose color
    scheme is the basis for Basic Strategy charts printed today.
</p>
<p>
    I LOVE this book and it was the first blackjack book I ever read, but it is very
    outdated and most paperback copies don't have the charts printed in color.
