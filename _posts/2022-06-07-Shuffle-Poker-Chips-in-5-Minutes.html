    If you play live poker, you <i>must</i> know how to shuffle poker chips. If you don't,
    can you even claim to be a <i>real</i> poker player?

<p>
    So if you want to be taken seriously at the live poker table, you have to learn, too.
</p>

<h2>What do you need to Shuffle Poker Chips?</h2>
<p>
    To learn how to shuffle poker chips, you need three things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The proper materials</li>
    <li>Preparation</li>
    <li>Proper technique</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Most of the tutorials I've seen only talk about technique. That's usually fine if you're
    planning on practicing at a casino, but most people will be learning at home.
</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>
    There are two material items you need to shuffle poker chips:
    <ul>
        <li>Quality Poker Chips</li>
        <li>A Padded Surface</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Quality Poker Chips</h3>
<p>
    This is the obvious item, but it helps if you use chips that have a bit of wear and tear to
    them. It <i>really</i> helps. A rounded edge makes chip shuffling a lot easier than with a
    squared edge.
</p>

<h4>Metal Dollar Tokens</h4>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-06-09/01-chips-metal-slugs-600x518.jpg" alt="Metal Dollar Tokens" title="Metal Dollar Tokens" />
    <figcaption>
        These are the old dollar tokens you used to put in slot machines. Pictured above: Sands,
        Ceasars Palace, El Dorado, Hacienda, LV Hilton, MGM Grand.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    If you can get your hands on 8 of the old-school Vegas slot tokens, that is the absolute
    easiest type of chip you can start with. They are usually well weathered and are easy to
    shuffle. You basically just need to push them together and they'll shuffle themselves. It
    is a great way to get the feel of how the chips should be coming together and interleaving.
</p>

<h4>Slick Plastic Casino Chips</h4>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-06-09/02-slick-plastic-chips-600x401.jpg" alt="Slick Plastic Chips" title="Slick Plastic Chips" />
    <figcaption>
        These slick plastic chips were popular 15-10 years ago. They are more difficult to shuffle than composite chips.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    These older style chips are somewhat difficult to shuffle for the beginner. The chips tend to
    stick together.
</p>

<h4>Composite Clay/Plastic Chips</h4>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-06-09/03-composite-chips-600x396.jpg" alt="Composite Chips" title="Composite Chips" />
    <figcaption>
        Composite Clay/Plastic Chips are great for shuffling.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    These are the most popular style of casino chip and probably the easiest to shuffle (besides the metal tokens).
    They become a lot easier to shuffle if the edges are worn.
</p>

<h4>Standard "Home Game" Poker Chips</h4>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-06-09/04-home-game-chips-600x402.jpg" alt="Home Game Chips" title="Home Game Chips" />
    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And the poker chips commonly used in "home games" and available for relatively cheap on Amazon
    work well, too. Just make sure you break them in using techniques in the <i>preparation</i>
    part of this post.
</p>
<p>
    These work well, but they're not as heavy as casino chips. They don't have the same feel to the,
    but you shouldn't have a problem learning with these style chips.
</p>

<h3>A Padded Surface</h3>
<p>
    It's rare to see a chip shuffling tutorial talk about your practice surface. A lot of shitty
    videos I've seen just use a hard kitchen table.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-06-09/05-kitchen-table-700x382.jpg" alt="Shuffling chips on a hard kitchen counter" title="Shuffling chips on a hard kitchen counter" />
    <figcaption>
        YouTube videos that try to teach you how to shuffle chips will often use a hard kitchen-type
        counter. When shuffling chips, a hard surface is horrible to learn on.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    A hard kitchen table is a horrible surface for learning chip shuffling.
</p>
<p>
    You should try using one of the following surfaces to learn this skill (in order by highest preference):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A casino table/poker table</li>
    <li>A padded surface</li>
    <li>A thin towel or blanket over a hard table</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you're not near a poker table, I've found the next best thing is to use a padded dish drying
    mat. I found a
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MKL2VHR/" target="_blank">great one at Amazon</a>
    for under $11.
</p>

        You can buy a dish drying mat from Amazon for under $11 and they work great!

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>
    There are two main steps in preparing to shuffle chips.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wash the chips</li>
    <li>Wash your hands</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are two often overlooked steps in learning chip shuffling. Any oil in your hands is going to
    make learning a lot more difficult. Also, new poker chips will often have a fine powder on them,
    which makes precise handling of the chips hard.
</p>
<p>
    So wash your hands well before you start practicing. I would also have some hand wipes to give
    your hands a quick rinse if you build up any oil in your hands while practicing. Trust me,
    this is going to help you a lot more than you might realize.
</p>
<p>
    And wipe the chips down, as well. Old casino chips will often have oil on them from being
    man-handled for so long.
</p>

<h2>Technique</h2>
<p>
    You should learn how to shuffle chips in the following order:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shuffle 2+2 Metal Dollar Slugs (if available)</li>
    <li>Shuffle 4+4 Metal Dollar Slugs (if available)</li>
    <li>Shuffle 2+2 Poker Chips</li>
    <li>Shuffle 4+4 Poker Chips</li>
    <li>Shuffle 8+8 Poker Chips</li>
    <li>Shuffle 4+4 Chips (Hard Mode)</li>
    <li>Shuffle 8+8 Chips (Hard Mode)</li>
    <li><b>BONUS:</b> Repeat all these steps for your non-dominant hand (I did for this post!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shuffling Metal Dollar Slugs</h3>
<p>
    If you can get a hold of some old school metal dollar slugs that casinos used to use in slot
    machines, they are excellent for getting a feel for the shuffle.
</p>
<p>
    The edges are usually well-worn and you can basically just squeeze the tokens together and
    they will magically interleave.
</p>
