<p>
    You can simulate <b>THOUSANDS</b> of Roulette Spins EASILY and for <i>FREE</i> with a simple spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
    And you can create this spreadsheet easily by following the steps I've laid out in my latest video:
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4wVOCK1nGU?si=evdLfhgbNU7FzSCl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
    But if you just want a copy of this spreadsheet, there's a much easier way to get your hands on it.
</p>

<p>
    Everything you need to create the spreadsheet from scratch is included in
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4wVOCK1nGU?si=evdLfhgbNU7FzSCl" target="_blank">the video</a>.
    But if you just want to hit the ground running, it's possible to just download a copy!
</p>
<p>
    If you become a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jackace/membership" target="_blank">paid Patreon member</a>,
    you can have access to pre-baked copies of the latest version of this spreadsheet. The video was just
    released yesterday, and there has already been several improvements on the look and feel of the spreadsheet.

    cards, access to an exclusive private <a href="https://discord.gg/R6nTPzcpma" target="_blank">Discord channel</a>,

    of that, too.
