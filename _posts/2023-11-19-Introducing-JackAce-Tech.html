<p>
    JackAce.com is launching our <b>SECOND</b> YouTube channel this week! Introducing the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JackAceTech?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">JackAce Tech Channel</a>!
</p>
<p>
    This channel will cover the broad topic of Technology, but will focus on Home Automation, 
    Home Security, and Home Networking. And the inaugural video is a review on the
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3ugGxmq" target="_blank">Eufy Home Security Camera</a> system,
    which I am using to replace my current home security camera system, Arlo.

<p>
    I have been trying to implement as many Home Automation systems as I possibly can since
    buying my current home in 2018. This includes the SmartThings Hub, over 20 Z-Wave light switches,
    7 Z-Wave deadbolts and door locks, 9 motorized window shades, 2 smart thermostats, and a
    10 camera system in my house, just to name a few. This channel will cover the implementation
    and reviews of these types of items and more!
</p>
<p>
    So please take a moment to watch the channel's
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbmK_7FilBA" target="_blank">first video</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>And then "Like" it.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>And then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JackAceTech?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">subscribe</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    I'd really, really appreciate it if you did! <b>Peace Out, donkeys!</b> ü´èü´èü´è
