    <b>NO STRING BETS!</b>
</p>
<p>
    A <i>"String Bet"</i> in Poker is when you add money to the pot in multiple actions. 
</p>

<p>
    This can be in the form of reaching back for more chips once you've already put
    money in the pot. Or it can be verbal, where you say something like
    "I call...<i>AND RAISE A BILLION DOLLARS</i>!"
</p>
<p>
    If you do this at a poker table, You'll get called out immediately. And for good reason.
</p>
<p>
    Most people say disallowing string bets prevents a player from getting an unfair read on an
    opponent.
</p>
<p>
    If it looks like your opponent is on the fence of folding, you might try to manipulate them
    by tipping the scales and adding more to your bet with a string bet.
</p>
<p>
    Trying to induce tells is an angle shoot that is eliminated when you get rid of string bets,
    but that's not the only reason it's prohibited.
</p>
<p>
    Eliminating string bets ultimately speeds up the game. When you perform multiple actions
    on the same bet, your actions can be ambiguous. And I think this is the biggest reason for
    prohibiting string bets.
</p>
<p>
    So you want to bet, put the entire bet out at once.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to call, just say call 
</p>
<p>
    If you want to raise, announce “raise” and put out the entire amount, including the bet
    you're calling.
</p>
<p>
    But whatever you do...<b>NO STRING BETS</b>!
