<p>
    In an effort to streamline the Roulette System submission process, we're moving the
    the submissions to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/systems/submit">Google Forms</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Managing the submissions in a Discord channel just proved to be too disorganized. Plus,
    by using Google Forms, we can enforce a higher quality of data that we collect for the
    systems.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, you're <i>still</i> welcome to join my
    <a href="https://discord.gg/R6nTPzcpma" target="_blank">Discord</a>!
    We're growing fast and the community is active in discussing Roulette and many other
    casino games!
