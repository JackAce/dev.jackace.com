<p>
    The onslaught of new features for
    <a href="{{site.base_url}}/gambling/roulette/systems/">the JackAce Roulette System Catalog</a>
    continues! We're adding simulation results to the catalog!
</p>
<p>
    These are the results of hitting various winning goals using the
    JackAce Roulette Simulator, which performs thousands of trials of the
    designated roulette system.
</p>

<p>
    As many of you know, I have written a Roulette Simulator that is featured in many of my
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf7_Bpai9n_0QB2oymATStZFYrE7sSIbT" target="_blank">Roulette videos</a>.
    I use the results of the simulations to help give my overall rating of each system.
    Now you can see these results in the system details as well!
</p>
<p>
    I haven't recorded simulations for every system. In fact, I will probably only run
    sims for systems that either I or CEG give a good rating.
</p>
<p>
    If you want me to add simulator stats for your favorite system, let me know! The best
    way to get a hold of me is probably through
