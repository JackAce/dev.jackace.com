        If you have more than $10k in crypto, you should have a hardware wallet...or two.

<p>
    If all of your crypto is on an exchange, do you really own it?
</p>

<p>
    If that exchange gets shut down or if an employee decides to walk away with
    the company's coffer, how would you get your money back?
</p>
<p>
    The short answer is <i>you won't</i>.
</p>
<p>
    There is little to no protection for a crypto investor with their assets in a crypto
    exchange. The FDIC won't protect you from large losses if the exchange goes under or if
    they just decide they don't like you and they don't want to honor your deposit.

    If you have more than $10,000 worth of crypto, a small
    <a href="https://affil.trezor.io/aff_c?offer_id=134&aff_id=33252" target="_blank">$70 investment</a>
    in a hardware wallet can prevent such a disaster and can offer you peace of mind.
</p>

<p>
    There are 2 major hardware wallet manufacturers and many models to choose from, so which do you
    choose?
</p>
<p>
    Not only will I show you your best harware wallet options, but you could be one of <i>THREE WINNERS</i>
    of a Trezor 1 crypto hardware wallet!
</p>

<h3>Why use a Hardware Wallet?</h3>
<p>
    Even if you're new to crypto, you've probably heard the mantra <b>“NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COIN!”</b>
</p>
<p>
    The reason why this is such a common phrase is because crypto exchanges and other crypto sites are
    known for flying by the seat of their pants. They usually have bad security, bad management, and
    there could just be good ol' fashioned malice!
</p>
<p>
    All these factors should make you want to get your crypto off these sites and in your control as
    soon as possible. And the best place to store your crypto is on a hardware wallet.
</p>

<h3>Which Hardware Manufacturer Should you Use?</h3>
<p>
    The two major hardware wallet manufacturers are
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com" target="_blank">Ledger</a> and
    <a href="https://www.trezor.io/" target="_blank">Trezor</a>.
</p>

<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/02-wallets-trezor-ledger-800x450.png" alt="The Trezor1 and Ledger Nano" />
    <figcaption>
        Trezor introduced the Trezor1 in 2014. Ledger introduced the Ledger Nano in 2016. At one
        time, I had over $350,000 in crypto on Celsius' site.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Both companies have been supplying <b>HODLERS</b> with secure crypto hardware wallets since
    the mid 2010s. Trezor was first to market and released the Trezor One in 2014,
    and Ledger released the Ledger Nano in 2016.
</p>
<p>
    Both wallets can safely authorize the outbound transfer of many different cryptocurrencies
    without the user having to know or manually secure the private key associated with each
    address.
</p>
<p>
    Both companies provide solutions for around 70 to 80 dollars that secure your private keys
    behind a seed phrase using the BIP 39 specification, and both companies have done a great
    job keeping customers' crypto secure.
</p>
<p>
    I don't really think one wallet offers more security than the other.
    Both companies provide products that offer secure ways to store your crypto.
</p>
<h4>Which Coins are Supported?</h4>
<p>
    For most people, the number one factor in picking a hardware wallet is which coins are
    supported. If your crypto holdings contain more than just <i>Bitcoin</i>, <i>Ethereum</i>,
    and <i>ERC-20</i> associated tokens, then you have to make sure the hardware wallet you
    choose supports your favorite coin.
</p>
<p>
    If your coin isn't supported, then all the security in the world isn't going to help you
    get your coins off an exchange.
</p>
<p>
    Trezor supports over 70 coins and tokens, and Ledger seems to have that beat with support
    for hundreds of coins and tokens. So if your coin is only supported by one or the other,
    your choice is clear. Just go directly to the Trezor and Ledger websites to make sure the
    coin you HODL is supported.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/03-supported-coins-trezor-600x489.png" alt="Trezor has support for over 70 coins and tokens" />
    <figcaption>
        Check the Trezor and Ledger web sites to see if it supports your favorite coins. Trezor supports
        over 70 coins/tokens. Ledger supports over 500.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Which is the best value?</h4>
<p>
    So if all your coins are supported by both, then you can pick a hardware wallet that fits
    your budget.
</p>
<p>
    Both have entry level models that start at 60 or 70 dollars and these are perfectly good
    devices that will do everything you need it to. And if you want a better experience,
    such as a color screen, larger display, touch screen, the Trezor offers the
    <a href="https://affil.trezor.io/aff_c?offer_id=134&aff_id=33252" target="_blank">Model T</a>
    for $220 and Ledger offers the Ledger Nano X for $150 and the Ledger Stax for $280.
</p>
<p>
    Going for the higher model should depend on how much you value the premium experience and,
    of course how much crypto you're entrusting it with. Both companies offer a variety of
    different experiences at different tiers, so you'll just have to compare each model to see
    if the added value is worth it to you.
</p>

<h4>Which device has the best User Interface?</h4>
<p>
    As far as the desktop apps go, both offer a <i>great</i> experience.
</p>
<p>
    Ledger has Ledger Live to view crypto balances and to initiate transactions,
    and Trezor has Trezor Suite which offers a similar experience.
    But as far as the user experience on the device itself goes, I've found that
    Trezor has the best User Interface.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/04-ledger-live-desktop-600x406.png" alt="Ledger Live" />
    <figcaption>
        Ledger Live is the Desktop Application for Managing crypto on your Ledger device.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    With the Ledger, adding support for each coin requires installing a separate “app”
    on the device. What was even more frustrating to me was that their first model only
    had the capacity to store 4 or 5 apps at a time, so managing more coins than that
    often required uninstalling and reinstalling apps.
</p>
<p>
    Since then, they've addressed this issue with the Model S Plus and newer models,
    but I still find navigating from app to app a bit cumbersome on the device.
</p>
<p>
    I believe Trezor has the superior UI, especially if you have the touchscreen Model T.
    But even the Trezor 1 is simple to use and the larger screen has always made it a lot
    easier to navigate.
</p>

<h4>Giant Corporate Red Flags</h4>
<h5>Hacked Marketing Database</h5>
<p>
    But apart from the device itself and the desktop app experience, I have a <i>big</i>
    problem with Ledger, because back in 2020, I was a victim of the hack that they suffered.
</p>
<p>
    And to be clear, no coins were stolen and the hardware itself wasn't compromised, but
    their customer list was appropriated by hackers in July 2020.
</p>
<p>
    Hackers were able to get a hold of customer's names, email addresses, phone numbers,
    and home addresses...<i>and they got mine</i>!
</p>

<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/05-ledger-article-db-leaked-600x670.png" alt="Ledger's Customer DB was Leaked" />
    <figcaption>
        Ledger's database of customer data was stolen by hackers who have targeted customers in
        phishing attempts.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    I was targeted by a phishing attempt by hackers who sent me an email with a link that
    I almost clicked on…but to say I felt violated because Ledger allowed this to happen
    is a big understatement. And I'm 100% certain these scammers got my email address through
    Ledger's leaked list because the email address they sent it to was used EXCLUSIVELY to
    purchase the ledger online.
</p>
<p>
    Since I own and manage my own domain names, I always create a new email address for every
    online account I create for security purposes. Luckily, I've moved to a new home since the
    data breach happened, but you can imagine how scary it is to know that criminals not only
    know your home address, but know that you ordered a device specifically used to hold
    countless wealth.    
</p>
<p>
    Leaking thousands of customers' addresses is like sending out thousands of treasure maps
    to cybercriminals who are just a lead pipe away from having you give up your PIN or seed
    phrase.
</p>

<h5>Ledger Recover</h5>
<p>
    And then just a few weeks ago in May, Ledger announced a feature called
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ledger-recover" target="_blank">“Ledger Recover”</a>
    that caused a big stir in the crypto world.
</p>
<p>
    The Ledger Recover feature was supposed to allow users to have their seed phrase sent off
    the device in pieces to a list of trusted people who can help you unify the phrase and
    regain access to your wallet addresses.
</p>

<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/06-ledger-recover-article-600x635.png" alt="Ledger Recover was HATED by the Crypto community." />
    <figcaption>
        Ledger Recover was announced and almost immediately suspended after a HUGE outcry from
        the crypto community.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Whether authorized or not, many people were concerned that the wallet was able to leak the
    seed phrase at all, as this really goes against the whole point of having the wallet be the
    firewall between your computer and your private keys.    
</p>
<p>
    Having the ability to recover your seed phrase means that firewall becomes a gateway able
    to broadcast that super sensitive data.
</p>

<h5>Other Missteps</h5>
<p>
    And to add salt to the wound, Ledger was criticized for making other missteps, including
    creating models with fashionable colors and a sporty lanyard that basically painted a
    bullseye on the wearer as a Mark for getting robbed.
</p>

<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/07-ledger-onchain-article-600x862.png" alt="The crypto world hates many of the recent products announced by Ledger." />
    <figcaption>
        Ledger 'OnChain' was a stylish lanyard to let criminals know you should be robbed.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    It just appears that Ledger is constantly working on solving problems that no one has.
    And these changes seem to actively make their product less desirable.
</p>
<p>
    So for these reasons, I'm a huge supporter of Trezor and their line of products.
    If they support your coins, then they're definitely what I'd recommend you use.    
    And that's why I'm giving away 3 Trezor Model Ones!
</p>
<p>
    They're not paying me to make this blog post, but they <i>are</i> supplying the prizes
    for this giveaway. You'll be shipped the wallet directly from Satoshi Labs, the company
    behind Trezor.

<h3>Quick Crypto Wallet Tips</h3>
<p>
    When you make the leap into crypto self-custody, there are a couple of tips you can
    follow to keep your crypto extra secure.
</p>

<h4>How to Store your Seed Phrase</h4>
<h5>Pen and Paper</h5>
<p>
    There are a few options for storing your seed phrase. The basic approach to securing
    your seed phrase is to just use pen and paper. Just write down your 24 word phrase
    on paper and store it in a secure place like a safe in your home.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/08-wallet-paper-600x300.png" alt="Paper Crypto Wallet" />
    <figcaption>
        A paper crypto "wallet" is cheap and works, but is easily subject to damage.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>Steel Wallet</h5>
<p>
    Another option is to store the phrase on a steel wallet that is stamped, etched, or
    assembled with alphabetic tiles. This is more secure than paper, since it's resistant
    to damage from flood and general wear and tear.
</p>
<p>
    But this option can cost between 50 and 75 dollars. And if you mess up while scribing
    your seed words, you could ruin the whole steel wallet.
</p>

<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/09-wallet-steel-600x382.png" alt="Steel Crypto Wallet" />
    <figcaption>
        A steel crypto wallet can cost $50 to $75 and offers many advantages over pen and paper.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h5>Fender Washer Wallet</h5>
<p>
    So I prefer to use something cheaper and something that's a lot easier to fix when you
    make a mistake. I've been etching the phrase on fender washers that cost about 6 cents
    each.
</p>
<p>
    Scribing the entire 24 word phrase on 12 washers (front and back) only costs under a
    dollar, even if I cap the washers off with blanks.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-08-08-wallets/10-wallet-fender-600x450.png" alt="Fender Washer Crypto Wallet" />
    <figcaption>
        A steel wallet using Fender washers can be made for under $2.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    But whatever you do, DON'T store the seed phrase electronically.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Don't put it in a Google Doc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't store it in the cloud.
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't even save it in a password manager.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It's not safe in <i>ANY</i> of those places.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, whenever I record any of my seed phrases, I make sure I don't accidentally
    expose the paper to any of the cloud connected security cameras I have around my house.
    It would be extremely easy for someone to scrub through text files stored in the cloud
    and check for a list of words that match the 2048 possible seed phrase words specified
    in the BIP-39 specification.
</p>

<h4>Use 2 Wallets!</h4>
<p>
    And if you can afford it, it really helps if you have two of the same hardware wallet.
</p>

<h5>Check your Seed Phrase with a 2nd Wallet</h5>
<p>
    With 2 wallets, you can check to make sure you've recorded your seed phrase correctly
    without having to reset and restore your main wallet from scratch.
</p>
<p>
    If at any point your seed phrase gets lost, you can initialize the backup wallet and
    transfer your coins to it with just your PIN.
</p>
<p>
    And another thing I do with my backup wallet is apply firmware updates to it first.
</p>

<h5>Dry Run Firmware Updates on the 2nd Wallet</h5>
<p>
    I'll apply firmware updates to the second wallet to see if everything still works
    properly before updating the firmware in my main wallet. Because if you apply a bad
    firmware update or if you leave the device in a bad state, you might end up bricking
    it, making it completely useless.
</p>
<p>
    And you'd have to buy a new one, wait a few days while it's delivered, and restore
    your seed phrase to regain access to your coins.
</p>
<p>
    For those two reasons and for many more, it's just better to have two devices available.
</p>

<h3>The Dangers of Self-Custody</h3>
<p>
    Of course, there are dangers of self-custody as well.
</p>
<p>
    When you're in charge of maintaining your seed phrase, you're really in charge.
    There's no way to reset your password if you forget it like with Gmail or your
    Apple ID.
</p>
<p>
    So if you lose your seed phrase, it's a <i>CERTAINTY</i> that you won't be able
    to recover your crypto from scratch.
