    Want to submit your Roulette System for JackAce to review? Just join our
    <a href="https://discord.gg/R6nTPzcpma">Discord</a>!
</p>

<p>
    Jack Haze has set up a new Discord Server and it's ready to accept your
    <a href="https://discord.com/channels/911456015860510720/1097961115390054530" target="_blank">Roulette
    Strategy submissions</a>!
</p>
<p>
    Jack's Discord server is meant to be a place where serious gamblers can have
    discussions about their favorite table games, crypto, and anything that falls
    under the category of Geek culture.
</p>
<p>
    It's a small community, but it's a great way to get a direct conversation going
    with Jack if you have a question about gambling, math, crypto, or Old School
    Hip Hop.
