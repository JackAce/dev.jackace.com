<p>
    Die Hard Roulette players play single zero Roulette. And Die Hard Roulette players
    use the Racetrack layout.
</p>

<p>
    The Racetrack layout is associated with traditional Roulette played in France (the word 
    "Roulette" itself is French for "small wheel").
</p>
<p>
    The Racetrack Roulette layout supplements the "Outside" bets on the American Roulette
    layout and provides additional options for multi-number betting that you can't easily
    do without making multiple bets.
</p>

<p>
    The types of bets you can make on the Racetrack layout can be divided into two different
    types of wagers: <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.
