<p>
    I've been playing <b>A LOT</b> of <i>Plinko</i> over the past few weeks.
</p>
<p>
    If you haven't seen it before, Plinko is a popular game on
    <a href="https://stake.us/?c=JackAce" target="_blank">Stake.us</a> that resembles
    the famous <i>Price is Right</i> game with the same name.
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvLXGHuSfkg?si=0QXmRUkJY2YyJygC&amp;start=150" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
    There are two major differences between the Price is Right version and the one
    you can play on Stake.
</p>
<p>
    The first difference is that the <i>biggest prize slots</i> are
    located on the <i>outer edges</i> on Stake. This means that you don't want your balls
    to fall according to the patterns found on a bell curve. You want your balls to
    land on the extreme edges of the board, so that you win the biggest prizes.
</p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-12-09-plinko/01-plinko-board-550x498.png" alt="The Pinko Board (16 rows/High risk)" />
    <figcaption>
        The Plinko board with 16 rows and "High" risk offers the highest possible payout of
        1000x for a single bet.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    The second difference is that all balls are dropped from the same position,
    the middle position. This means that your overall results <i>will</i>
    most likely resemble a bell curve if you launch a flurry of balls at once.
</p>

<h3>Game Configurations</h3>
<p>
    Even though you don't have any decisions to make regarding where the ball is dropped
    or where the ball lands, you still have a hand in deciding your fate. There are two
    settings for the game that you can change to suit to your liking: The number of <b>Rows</b>,
    and the level of <b>Risk</b>.
</p>

<h4>Rows</h4>
<p>
    The <b>Number of Rows</b> is the number of horizontal rows of pegs the ball must drop
    through. This does <i>NOT</i> correspond to the number of prize slots that are available.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-12-09-plinko/02-plinko-rows-600x465.png" alt="Plinko board with 16 Rows" />
    <figcaption>
        The number of rows is the number of horizontal rows of pegs, not the number of slots on
        the bottom of the board.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    The more rows you choose, the larger the field of possible results. There is always one more slot
    than there are rows selected. So for the 8 row config, there are 9 possible slots. For the 16 row
    config, there are 17 possible slots.
</p>
<p>
    With more rows, you have a wider range of possible winning slots, which also means you have
    the ability to win a larger multiple of your original bet. With the 16 row configuration, it
    is possible to win up to 1000x your initial wager.
</p>

<h4>Risk</h4>
<p>
    You can also choose between one of three levels of <b>"Risk"</b>: 
    <span class="amt-pos">Low</span>,
    <span class="amt-med">Medium</span>, and
    <span class="amt-neg">High</span>.
</p>
<p>
    The lower levels offer a flatter payout structure, and the worst slots will pay out more. For
    example,  all <span class="amt-neg">High</span> risk will pay out only 20% of your initial bet
    on the worst payout slots. On the Low risk tier, some of the configurations will <i>still</i>
    pay out 70% on even the WORST outcomes.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-12-09-plinko/03-plinko-risk-600x277.png" alt="Plinko Low Risk vs. High Risk" />
    <figcaption>
        The payout structure is much more flat for the <span class="amt-pos">Low</span> risk tier. The
        <span class="amt-neg">High</span> risk tier has the possibility of losing more money,
        but you can reap much higher rewards.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Not only do you have the potential to lose more money (e.g. losing
    <span class="amt-neg">80%</span> versus losing <span class="amt-neg">30%</span>
    in the extreme case), but there are often more slots where you lose (e.g. 5 losing
    slots versus 1 losing slot). 
</p>
<p>
    And with that higher risk, you gain the possibility of a higher reward. For all the
    <span class="amt-neg">High</span> risk tiers, the top prize slots are much much higher
    than the extremes on the <span class="amt-pos">Low</span> tiers.
</p>
<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>
    For the purposes of this blog post, the combination of Number of Rows and the Risk level
    selected is considered a <b>"Configuration"</b>. So one configuration might be
    "16 Rows/<span class="amt-neg">High</span> Risk". Another configuration might be "10 Rows/<span class="amt-med">Medium</span> Risk".
</p>

<h3>House Edge</h3>
<h4>Winning Slot Probabilities</h4>
<p>
    So, how do each of these configurations affect the overall house edge?
</p>
<p>
    The distribution of results is going to vary based on the probability of hitting each of the prize slots.
    The probability of hitting each of the slots is meant to represent a bell curve, but it's difficult to
    say whether the probabilities assigned are meant to mimic any kind of real-world simulation results for
    balls dropped in a hypothetical Plinko aparatus.
</p>
<p>
    If you hover your mouse over each of the prize slots, it will show you the probability of hitting that
    slot.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-12-09-plinko/04-plinko-probability-500x145.png" alt="Winning 40% of your wager will happen 2.7771% of the time for this configuration." />
    <figcaption>
        You can hover your mouse over each slot to see the probability of hitting it.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    I haven't done any sampling to see how accurate these probabilities are. Since the probability of hitting
    the most <i>REMOTE</i> slot on the 16 row configurations is 0.0015%, that means you will expect to hit it
    once ever 66,667 trials. Trying to see whether Stake's advertised probabilities fall in line with sample
    trials would require <i>MILLIONS</i> of trials.
</p>
<p>
    I really don't have reason to believe that Stake would cheat, so I'm just going to accept them at their
    word.
</p>

<h4>Calculating the House Edge</h4>
<p>
    Since we know the probabilities of hitting each slot and we know how much each slot pays, we can calculate
    the house edge for every configuration. So that's what I did! There are 9 different row values to choose
    from and there are 3 risk levels. That means there is a total of 27 different configurations.
</p>

<h4>Lowest House Edge</h4>
<p>
    So which config is the best one for the player? Which config results in the lowest house edge?
</p>
<p>
    Selecting 11 Rows with <span class="amt-neg">High</span> risk results in the lowest house edge. Your expected result for a $1 wager is
    $0.991526, which is a house edge of only 0.8474%. With this configuration, you still have the possibility
    of winning 120x, which will happen 0.0488% of the time, or once in every 2049 balls.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-12-09-plinko/05-plinko-lowest-house-edge-600x230.png" alt="11 Rows with High Risk has an EV of 0.991526" />
    <figcaption>
        11 Rows with <span class="amt-neg">High</span> Risk results in the lowest house edge of 0.8474% (highest EV of 0.991526).
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>WORST House Edge</h4>
<p>
    And which configuration is the worst?
</p>
<p>
    The Highest House Edge happens with the 8 Row/<span class="amt-med">Medium</span> Risk configuration. This config has a 1.0944% house edge.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-12-09-plinko/06-plinko-highest-house-edge-600x182.png" alt="8 Rows with Medium Risk has an EV of 0.989056" />
    <figcaption>
        8 Rows with <span class="amt-med">Medium</span> Risk results in the highest house edge of 1.0944% (lowest EV of 0.989056).
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Additional Resources</h3>
<p>
    Out of the 27 different configurations, there is just a 0.2470% difference between the best and worst house edges.
    For most intents and purposes, you can just assume the overall house edge is just 1% for Plinko (at least at the time
    of this writing).
</p>
<p>
    And you can see my findings for all 27 configurations <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/plinko/">here</a>. This page
    also includes the graphs for all 9 row settings such as the graph below. This graph displays the distribution of
    value for each of the slots for the three risk levels:
    <span class="amt-neg">High</span> (red),
    <span class="amt-med">Medium</span> (yellow), and
    <span class="amt-pos">Low</span> (green).
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-12-09-plinko/07-plinko-graph-600x356.png" alt="Graph for the 16 Row Configurations" />
    <figcaption>
        This graph displays the distribution of Expected Value for the
        <span class="amt-neg">High</span> (red),
        <span class="amt-med">Medium</span> (yellow), and
        <span class="amt-pos">Low</span> (Green) risk
        levels.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Looking at the graph above, you can see that for the <span class="amt-neg">High</span> risk level, most
    of the value is given to the outside slots, where you earn up to 1000x your wager. For the
    <span class="amt-neg">High</span> risk level, you lose a lot of value in the middle slots. And for all
    three risk levels, there are inflection points on the 6th and 12th slots. At these points, the
    distribution of value crosses over for all three risk levels.
</p>
<p>
    And you'll see similar characteristics for the other Row settings. The <span class="amt-neg">High</span> risk levels will all have higher value on the
    outer slots, and these get inverted in the middle slots.
