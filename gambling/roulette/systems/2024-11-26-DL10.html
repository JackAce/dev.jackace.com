<p>
    D'Alembert with 10 numbers straight-up. Just pick any 10 numbers. Not sure
    why there was a blank spin.
</p>
<p>
    When you win, pull back a unit until you only have 1 unit on each bet. When you
    lose, increase by $1 on each bet.
</p>
<p>
    You just keep pressing until you can't bet anymore. This is like other D'Alembert
    variants. I've only shown the payouts for the first 3 tiers, but just multiply $26
    by your unit bet to figure out how much you're going to win.

    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=430 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=250 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    It would be an {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="a" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    if there were more opportunity to win big.
