<p>
    This is a twist on 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-07-31-Degenerate-Tie-Fighter" -%},
    where you press your winnings on the center bet (Double Street bet).
</p>
<p>
    When you win, you press $5 on tha 16-21 Double Street bet until it hits $100.
</p>
<p>
    Reset back to the $75 win when you hit the Double Street or if you get whacked.
</p>
<p>
    Walk when you get whacked 2x in a row or when you're tired of winning.
