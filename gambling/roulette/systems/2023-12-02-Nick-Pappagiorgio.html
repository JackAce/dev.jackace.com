<p>
    Multi-Leg System
</p>
<p>
    Not sure what is going on with the "Martingale" levels here. You're supposed to 3x Martingale,
    but the 3rd level is 2 x $200?
</p>
<p>
    Betting levels:
</p>
<li>
    <ul>
        2 x $25
    </ul>
    <ul>
        2 x $75
    </ul>
    <ul>
        2 x $200
    </ul>
    <ul>
        2 x $450
    </ul>
    <ul>
        2 x $1000
    </ul>
</li>
<p>
    Walk when you're up $600 according to the system author.
</p>
<p>
    Alex was up $1100 at the end, but I have him up $1000. Not sure what the discrepancy is.
