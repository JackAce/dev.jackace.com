title: Tag Team the Streets - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    Bet 3 overlapping Double Streets. When you lose, increase by one unit until you hit 6 units...
    then go back to 5 units (??? wtf ???).
</p>
<p>
    When you win, reset to step 1.

    Near the end Alex switched to a
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-12-17-36DD" displayName="D'Alembert" %}
    progression.
