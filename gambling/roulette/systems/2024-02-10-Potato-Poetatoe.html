title: Potato Poetatoe 🥔🍟 - Roulette System Review
---

<p> 
    Fontainebleau charges $95 for a baked potato, hence this $95 system.

    I really hate it when the system author doesn't take time to calculate the payouts correctly. The
    video had 2 incorrect payouts. They said the 0/00 lost $10, but it only loses $5. They said the
    black numbers in the first column wins $170, but it only wins $85.
