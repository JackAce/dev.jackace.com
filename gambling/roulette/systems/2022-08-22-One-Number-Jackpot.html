<p>
    For this system, you pick a number 1-36 and bet all the bets containing that number. It's single unit bets
    on the inside, and 3 units on the dozens/columns, and even money bets.

    David said this was "also known as the 'Complete' bet", but this is not accurate. The 'Complete' bet is a
    single 40-unit bet on a number in the middle column that gets distributed into
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        One 1-unit Straight-up bet
    </li>
    <li>
        Four 2-unit Split bets
    </li>
    <li>
        One 3-unit Street bet
    </li>
    <li>
        Four 4-unit Corner bets
    </li>
    <li>
        Two 6-unit Double-Street bets
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A 'Complete' bet does not contain any outside bets (dozens/columns or even money bets).
</p>

    I'm giving this system a "D" because there are too many moving parts. I think if you were to just pick a single
    number and consistently bet it, you could familiarize yourself with the payouts. When you change the number, 
    the wins and losses have to be re-calculated for every spin and every result. That makes it more difficult to
    determine if you're being fairly paid on every spin.
