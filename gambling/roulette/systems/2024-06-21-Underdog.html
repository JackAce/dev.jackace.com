<p>
    Two level system. 3+ bullets.
</p>
<p>
    Double Street Martingale starting bet plus $25 on a Dozen. That dozen pays
    $75. The other winning bets push. 8 whacks.
</p>
<p>
    When that hits, take the $75 profit and bet $25 on a column, and $10 each on 5 non-overlapping Splits.
    They quoted incorrect payouts for the Split wins. They win $105. 
</p>
<p>
    CEG messed up the win/loss display for the 2nd tier split bets. They only win $105,
    they don't win $180.

    Looks like Alex was paid correctly, though.
