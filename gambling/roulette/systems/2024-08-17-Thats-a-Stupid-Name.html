    There was a discrepancy at the end:
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=95 %} (Alex's total) versus
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=75 %} (my calculation).

    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="c" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    I would give it a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%},
    if the progression were easier.
