    When you lose, bet the next betting level. When you win, reset back to $10.

    I'm giving this system an F because the betting progression is too complicated and really doesn't add anything
    beyond a traditional Even Money Martingale system. Making it a 2 to 1 bet only makes it harder to win and you're
    going to hit the table limit (or your personal limit) a lot more often.
