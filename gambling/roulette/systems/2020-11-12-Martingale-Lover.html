<p>
    This is also known as "All the Martingale" and "Martingale Gangbang"
</p>

    Pick 3 overlapaping even money bets and bet 1 unit each. Pick one dozen and one column and bet 1 unit each. Martingale when you lose.

    My totals are off by $10. I have them up $720, but they were up $730 at the end.
