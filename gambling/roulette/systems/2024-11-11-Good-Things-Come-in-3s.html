<p>
    This starts out with two Dozen bets, then launches into Triple Entry Max Climax.
</p>
<p>
    When you bet the 3 even money bets, if you win 1/3, then you drop down to two
    Dozen bets with the remaining money. If you win 2/3, press the winnings into
    two dozen bets. When you win 3/3, then start over at tier 1.

<p>
    I think this system is just too complicated with too many possibilites for each
    step and there's little opportunity to win big.

    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=510 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=530 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    It would be an {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="a" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    if there were more opportunity to win big.
