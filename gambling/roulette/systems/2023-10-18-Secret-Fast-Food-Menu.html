title: Secret Fast Food Menu üçî - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    The system is named <i>Secret Fast Food Menu</i> for YouTube search
    engine optimization. It's meant to be a false positive search result
    when someone is looking for secret menu items.
</p>
<p>
    Bet any 9 splits, but the system author suggest betting the splits
    that have like colors.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, you can pick any 18 numbers, including any of the Even
    Money bets.
</p>
<p>
    If you hit, you're supposed to double up the bets by just betting $1
    on each of the numbers straight up. Then win or lose, you return to
    the first tier.
</p>
<p>
    This system just seems like a two-step Piroli. You just try to win 2
    in a row instead of 3 or 4. I don't think the wins are big enough and
    I don't like making 9 and 18 bets at a time. I'd rather just make an
    even money bet.
