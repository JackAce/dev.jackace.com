    Negative Progression
</p>
<p>
    When you lose, double your last bet and add 1 unit.
</p>
<p>
    So with a $10 starting bet (2x$5 units), the betting progression would be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        $10
    </li>
    <li>
        $30
    </li>
    <li>
        $70
    </li>
    <li>
        $150
    </li>
    <li>
        $310
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There were other particulars of this betting system, but this video was just a mess.
</p>
<p>
    I have Alex being up $130, but there were $100 in wins ($70+$30) that weren't recorded. With 
    the additional $100, Alex should be up $230, which he was in the video.
