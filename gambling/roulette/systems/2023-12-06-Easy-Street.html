<p>
    This is a combination of Double Street Martingale and Fibonacci Dozens.
</p>
<p>
    Wait until a dozen hasn't hit 5 times (?) and then Run the Fibonacci sequence on it
    starting with a $50 bet. 
</p>
<p>
    Fibonacci sequence for this system would be $50, $50, $100, $150, $250, $400, $650, $1050, $1700...
</p>
<p>
    Alex was up $700 at the end, but I have him being up $650. Was there a $50 win that was not shown?
