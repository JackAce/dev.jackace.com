<p>
    Alex mostly left 1-6 empty instead of 1-3 and 34-36.
</p>
<p>
    There's a $10 discrepancy between my total and Alex's final chip count.
    I have him down $190. He was down $180 at the end.

<p>
    Play until you're up 20% or $100 according to the system author.
</p>
<p>
    When you get whacked, go to the next level and win 3x. Then return to
    the previous level (don't necessarily go back to the first tier).
