<p>
    Positive Progression where you press $5 on both bets when you win. This keeps the small win at $10,
    but increases the jackpot double street wins. When you win the big bet or when you lose, you reset
    to step 1.

    Alex changed the system mid-video.

<p>
    There was a discrepancy at the end:
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=410 %} (Alex's total) versus
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=230 %} (my calculation).
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="c" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    I would give it a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%},
    if the progression were easier.
