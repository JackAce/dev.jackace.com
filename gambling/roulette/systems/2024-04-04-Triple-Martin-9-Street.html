title: Triple Martin 9 Street 🛣️🛣️🛣️🛣️🛣️🛣️🛣️🛣️🛣️ - Roulette System Review

<p>
    Bet $10 on 9 Streets (any 9). If you lose, then double the bet and
    stay at that level until you hit 3 times. After 3 wins, reset to the
    first bet.

    Gave this a 
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="c" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=true -%},
    because it's not too terrible of a system. I think the Martingale
    aspect of it means you're almost certain to go broke if you play
    this for any extended amount of time.

    Alex ended up $365, but he should only have been up $360. And he was only
    up $360 because he dipped into the bank for more money to be able to
    afford the $720 bet. Otherwise, he would have gotten whacked 2x.
