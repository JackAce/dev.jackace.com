<p>
    Complicated system with 5 steps.
</p>
<p>
    Step 1: Bet tier 1 until you are up $125 (25 x $5 units). Then go to Tier 2.
</p>
<p>
    Step 2: Bet $5 Rumple and win 6 times. You'll be up another 12 units (claims the author - You'll actually be up 18 more units).
</p>
<p>
    Step 3: Bet $75 each on two dozens (or columns) for 3 wins or $225 (45 units)
</p>
<p>
    Step 4: Double Street Martingale with 5 x $75 bets.
</p>
<p>
    Step 5: YOLO the rest of the profits on an even money bet, which I believe is $590.
</p>
<p>
    This system is garbage, and the author's descripion doesn't seem to make sense.
