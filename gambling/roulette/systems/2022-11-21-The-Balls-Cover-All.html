<p>
    System progression:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Bet 2 Dozens at $15 each
        </li>
        <li>
            If that hits, then bet 2 Dozens at $20 each and $10 on an uncovered Double Street.
        </li>
        <li>
            If that hits, then add $5 to each of the 3 bets.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I only included images for the first 3 tiers of this system.

    I don't like that the bets don't increase in the same proportion. I think it would be better to
    increase the Double Street by $10 instead of $5 to keep the payouts identical.

    It seems like you have to have a VERY long streak of wins if you want to walk away with a
    profit. Most of the time you're going to hover around being even.
