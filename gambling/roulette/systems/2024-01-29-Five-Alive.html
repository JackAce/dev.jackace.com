<p> 
    A flat betting system where they're betting on 37 numbers. For some reason, there was a $25 discrepancy
    between my total and Alex's total. He said he was up $325, but I have him being up only $300.

<p>
    You should never bet on more than 35 numbers at a time, because you end up in a <b>Bet Nullification</b>
    situation. Watch this video to learn more about it:

    You can have the same exact results and save $225 when 
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="0" %} and
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="00" %} hit by just putting $25 on the 1st Dozen and removing the corner bets.
