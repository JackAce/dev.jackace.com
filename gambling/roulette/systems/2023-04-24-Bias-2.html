<p>
    Bet $5 around 2 numbers in the 1st or 3rd column ($45 on each).
</p>
<p>
    The suggested buy-in was $2000, but they only started with $1000.
</p>
<p>
    Alex was down
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=-320 %}
    at the end, but he must've gotten short-changed at some point. He should have only
    been down
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=-315 -%}.
</p>
