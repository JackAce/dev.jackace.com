    Press your bets when you win.
</p>
<p>
    If you only win 1/2 of the bets, then split the winnings amongst the
    two bets.
</p>
<p>
    If you win both bets, then double both bets. At 5:07, though, Alex parlays
    the entire win for $60 on each.

    This is a pretty vanilla system. Not sure why Alex and David both gave it a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="a" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=true -%}.
    Seems just like a typical positive progression. And Alex did so poorly with
    it on this trial.
