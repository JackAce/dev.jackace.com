<p>
    Multi-leg system combining Fibonacci + Double Your Loss Martingale.
</p>
<p>
    Bet $10 on High and $10 on a Dozen. You Fibonacci the Dozen and "Double Your Loss" Martingale the Even Money bet.
</p>
<p>
    Fibonacci: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 130, 210, 340, 550...
</p>
<p>
    Double Your Loss Martingale: 10, 20, 60, 150, 500, 1300... (I really don't understand this sequence).
</p>
<p>
    I'm not making images for all the possible types of bets. Just apply the progressions.
</p>
<p>
    If you're going to use a Multi-Leg system, try to make the bets as independent as possible. That usually
    means betting on a Column and a Dozen or a column and High/Low.
</p>
<p>
    Betting on two bets that have high correlation with each other means you're VERY likely to go BUST, because
    when one bet is doing well, it's more likely that the other bet is doing poorly and approaching the max bet.

    Alex was up $340, but I believe he should have been up $350.
