    Tier 1: Bet $25 on 5 Double Streets (ala Double Street Martingale).
</p>
<p>
    If that hits, go to Tier 2: Bet $25 on 5 Double Streets and add a $25 bet on any Even Money bet.

    If you get whacked, go to Tier 1. If you Push, then stay at tier 2. If you win go to Tier 3: Bet
    25 on 5 Double Streets and bet $25 on two Dozens each (with 100% overlap/shared winners of the dozens).
