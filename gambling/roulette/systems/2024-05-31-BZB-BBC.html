title: BZB BBC - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    BBC stands for "Big/Black/Columns". This is a Positive Progression system.
</p>
<p>
    Bet $50 on the Big (High) numbers.
</p>
<p>
    When that wins, add a $50 bet to Black.
</p>
<p>
    When both bets win, add two $50 Column bets. On a push in step 2, stay on step 2.
</p>
<p>
    Any loss resets to step 1.

    The editing for this video was missing a lot of key elements that the CEG videos usually
    have. It was really hard to follow what numbers were hitting, and there was no corroboration
    regarding the wins and losses. I did my best to make sure the values I recorded were correct.
