<p>
    Playing as two separate players is a complete waste of time. You can essentially make the same base bet by
    just betting $60 each on 2 dozens or columns.
</p>
<p>
    You're supposed to double up when you win, but each player is only betting $60 each.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not going to list all the different permutations for this system. Just double up 1/2 of the bets when
    they win (up to $120 bet). They increase the max bet later on.

    Alex was up $125 at the end...but how? Wins should all be multiples of $60. The two should have been up a
    total of $180.
