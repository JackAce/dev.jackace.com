<p>
    Bet $10 each on 2 dozens and keep pressing $10 each on each bet until you're up $100 from the starting point.
</p>
<p>
    Once you're up $100, then reset back to $10 each dozen.
</p>
<p>
    I think with this system it's too difficult to get out of the hole. You're going to find yourself unable to
    achieve that +100 goal.
