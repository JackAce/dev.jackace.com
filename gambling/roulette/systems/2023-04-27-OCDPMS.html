<p>
    This is a lame system where you alternate between betting Red and Black in an erratic pattern.
</p>
<p>
    Bet Red, Black, then Red Red, then Black Black...then back to the beginning...
</p>
<p>
    Bet $5, then $10, then $15, then $20, then $25, then back to $5.
</p>
<p>
    If you lose, keep Martingaling until you hit, then continue with the progression.
</p>
<p>
    I (hopefully) only need to provide the first betting image because this is all even money bets.
