title: True Loss Martingale Dozens - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    I've just shown the first tier of betting in the graphics. Just increase the individual Dozen
    bet when you lose according to the system bet sizes (25, 50, 150, 450, 1350).

    I know they said they won 999 times out of 1000, but this system is a disaster.
</p>
<p>
    Martingaling two independent bets is just asking to hit your limit.
