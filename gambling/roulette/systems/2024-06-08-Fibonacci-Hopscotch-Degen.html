title: Fibonacci Hopscotch Degen - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    When you lose on tier 1, begin a Fibonacci sequence. You'll bet $25 again. Then $50, then $75... and continue
    with Fib.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever you win (even in the middle of a Fib sequence), your next bet will be 2 bets of the same size on 2 dozens.
</p>
<p>
    Walk when you're up $250 or more.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not going to put the images up for the betting tiers. The even money bets are easy enough to figure out. The
    2 Dozen bets, you always win half of the total bet.
</p>
<p>
    I really don't like this system.
