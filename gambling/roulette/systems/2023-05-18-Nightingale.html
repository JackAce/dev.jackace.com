title: Nightingale - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This is a <i>twist</i> on the system <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/systems/2022-06-14-Hopscotch/">Hopscotch</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This system doesn't really make sense.
</p>
<p>
    Progression is $10, $20, $30 (?)... Alex was all over the map with the bets and I don't really understand why the bets seem to increase
    at different rates.
</p>
<p>
    The point of Martingale is to prevent getting wiped out, not to springboard a win, so I don't see why this system would be attractive
    to anyone. You're increasing your starting bet and betting <i>way</i> more than you might be down, which adds a ton of risk to a system
    that is meant to be low risk.
