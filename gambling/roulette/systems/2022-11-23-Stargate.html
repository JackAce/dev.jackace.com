    What I don't like about this strategy is that you're just dealing with 6 numbers. And you lose
    everything on 4 of those numbers and you win "Even Money" on 2 of them. So there is TWICE as many
    losses as wins.

    Yeah, most of the time you're going to push, but you're still going to lose twice as much as you
    win on average.
</p>
<p>
    This is a HUGE amount to be betting and risking on every spin. You could just bet $15 on the dozens
    and $5 on the corner bets to make this more reasonable, but then you won't be getting the comps...

    But you should NEVER just be "playing for comps". It's just not worth it ESPECIALLY in a game with
    such a high house edge like Roulette.
