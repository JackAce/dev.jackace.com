    You're supposed to bet the 3 neighbors of the last 3 spins (21 numbers in total). If you

    the neighbors is a complete waste of time.

    You're betting $5 on 21 numbers. If you only have $5 on the number, you'll win $75. If you
    double up a number, it'll win $255 if it hits. Tripled up numbers will win $435.
