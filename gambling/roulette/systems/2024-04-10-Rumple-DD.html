    with D'Alembert ladder system. You only move back
    down after winning 3x.

    What a horrible horrible horrible system. Multi-leg D'Alembert
    on 24 numbers is just idiotic. Especially with the multi-win requirement
    to go back down levels. You will almost always find yourself in
    a big hole that you can't crawl out of...as we saw with CEG's spins.
