<p>
    Ugh. Not a fan of having so many bets. Apparently, the layout of the bets is supposed to look
    like a castle?

    FYI - There is already a system named
    <a href="https://staging.jackace.com/gambling/roulette/systems/2022-10-26-The-Kings-Castle/">"The King's Castle"</a>
    from 2022-10-26.
