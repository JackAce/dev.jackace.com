<p>
    There are two different branches of this sytem.
</p>
<p>
    When you lose, you up your bet size according to the steps listed here:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=10 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=15 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=20 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=30 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=40 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=50 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=60 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=75 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=90 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=110 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=135 -%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%- include chip-amount.html chipAmount=165 -%}
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If one of those hits, you take the winnings and divide it in half and bet two dozens.
</p>
<p>
    If you win the 2 dozens bet, go back to step 1 ($10).
</p>
<p>
    If you lose the 2 dozens bet, continue with the NEXT step from where you were...
    (as if you didn't bet the 2 dozens bet)
</p>
<p>
    Because of the complexity of this system, I'm only providing payout graphics for the 2 different
    types of bets (Double Street and 2 Dozens)
