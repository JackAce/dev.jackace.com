<p>
    Bet $60 on 5 Double Streets for tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins you win $60, and bet $60 on an even money bet.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins you win $60, and bet $60 on two Dozens.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins you win $60, and bet $20/$20/$30/$20/$30 on 5 Double Streets.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins you win $60, and bet $120 straight-up on a single number. Alternately, you can split the $120 on
    multiple bets. Alex chose to bet $120 on {% include roulette-spot.html number="17" -%}.
</p>
<p>
    If you lose, you go back a level, you don't automatically reset to tier 1.
