    This system just delays the inevitable. Waiting for a streak of 3 does absolutely nothing to prevent
    you from losing when you look at the bets you actually make. It only just stops you from betting on
    every spin.

    You might think you'll only get caught with a big loss if there's a REALLY long streak of even money
    hits, but conditional probability says waiting does absolutely NOTHING to increase your probability
    of winning.

    Since the permutations of bets are too exhaustive to enumerate, I am only providing one graphic for
    this system. It should be easy to determine the payouts without referring to a graphic.
