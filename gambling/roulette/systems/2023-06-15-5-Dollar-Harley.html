title: $5 Harley üèçÔ∏è - Roulette System Review
math: true
---

<p>
    Progressive system where you get 2 small wins and then $20 Straight-up followed up by a $500 Straight-up.
</p>
<p>
    I like this system, but I think step 3 should be a little easier to hit (like a single Street?),
    before you go for the Jugular.

    In CEG's review, Alex asked me to calculate the probability of hitting the $500 jackpot. Here's the calculation:
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    \\
    \frac{18}{38} \times \frac{12}{38} \times \frac{1}{38} \times \frac{1}{38} &= \frac{216}{2085136} \\
    \\
    &= 0.00010359... \\
    \\
    &\approx \frac{1}{9653} \\
    \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    This means for every time we start with the $5 bet, we will be successful in winning the next 4 bets
    in a row about once every 9,653 attempts. Any loss will reset the attempt. But keep in mind that it's
    possible to "win bullets" along the way.
</p>
<p>
    Running this system through my simulator, I got the following stats:
</p>

</figure>
<p>
    Out of 10,000 trials, we hit the goal of "winning the Harley" a total of 39 times. The other
    9,961 times, we lost the $100.
</p>
<p>
    This seems about right. If only used 20 bullets per buy-in, we'd expect to be successful around 20 or
    21 times. But since it's possible to "win bullets" on the 2nd and 3rd tiers, that bumps that number
    up by almost double.
