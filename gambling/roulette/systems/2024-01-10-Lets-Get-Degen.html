title: Let's Get Degen ðŸŽ° - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This was supposed to be a flat betting system, but Alex got frustrated with all his losses and
    doubled up near the end.
</p>
<p>
    This was a BRUTAL set of spins, with EVERY spin a loss. Of the 21 spins, they all missed the 2nd column,
    except for the 
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="35" -%},
    which <i>STILL</i> lost 
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=-35 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    At the end, Alex had $115 left from his $700 buy-in. He was down $585, but I have him being down $555. There
    is a $30 discrepancy.
