<p>
    This is a 4 leg D'Alembert system betting on 2 Dozens and 2 Columns.
    The 2 Dozens increase and decrease as a single leg. The 2 Columns increase and
    decrease as their own leg.
</p>
<p>
    The Dozen bet should always be the 1st dozen. The Column bet follows the last spin.
</p>
<p>
    $4000 buy-in and walk when you're up $1000.
</p>
<p>
    I can't display all the permutations of all the bets.
