<p>
    This is a flat betting system with a max payout on the Double Street bet.
</p>
<p>
    The win for the Basket bet was quoted incorrectly in the video. Alex said it would win 
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=120 -%}, but it only wins 
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=50 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    You're supposed to walk when you're up
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=500 %}
    or more.
</p>
<p>
    On spin 15, Alex changed the flat bet system to the 'tier 2' version. I really like
    this alternate way of playing this. It results in 6 more donks, but the wins on the
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="1" %} -
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="6" %} are much, much better.
</p>
<!-- 
<p>
    There was a discrepancy at the end:
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=200 %} (Alex's total) versus
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=265 %} (my calculation).
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="d" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    It's almost an 
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="f" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}. 
</p>
<p>
    Most progression systems have you hover around the smallest unit bet. With this system, you're
    probably going to hover around the 3rd or 4th tier most of the time. From there, it's bound
    to spiral out of control.
