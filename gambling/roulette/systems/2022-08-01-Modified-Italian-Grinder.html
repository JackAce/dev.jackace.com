<p>
    There are NINE steps to this progressive system. Each level has 5 equally sized bets, with units of $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18.

    I've only captured the first level in the betting graphic. Just multiply the payouts for each level accordingly.

    For some reason, the video is reporting a $30 win at the 2nd level ($10 bet with 5x$2 bets). The win should be 2x$17 - 4x$2 = $34-8 = $26.
