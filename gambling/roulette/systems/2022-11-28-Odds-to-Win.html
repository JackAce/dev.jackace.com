    Not a fan.

    Seems like a waste of time to bet on each odd nummber AND bet on Odd. Why not just increase your bet on
    Odd and bet the 2nd Column instead?

    You could come up with a much easier system (although the payouts are slightly different) by betting 40 on
    the 2nd Column and 75 on Odd. Or 45 on the 2nd Column and 70 on Odd.
