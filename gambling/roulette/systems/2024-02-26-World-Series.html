    You start with 7 x $75 bets. You're going for a "best of 7" series...
</p>
<p>
    Bet $50 on an even money bet. If that wins...
</p>
<p>
    Bet $50 on a Dozen or Column. If that wins...
</p>
<p>
    Bet $150 on an Even money bet. If that wins...YOU WIN A GAME and go onto the next "game" until you win/lose 4 out of 7.

<p>
    If you lose any of the above bets, then you have $25 left in your game. Bet $25 on a Dozen or Column.
    If that wins, then go to Step 1 above.
