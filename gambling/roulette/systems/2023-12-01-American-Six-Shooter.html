    Multi-Leg System
</p>
<p>
    Since this is a Multi-Leg system, I won't provide betting pattern images besides the init. You'll just have to
    do the math yourself.
</p>
<p>
    This system was given a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating=d showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=true %}
    because of the exact reason it failed in the video. When you have a multi-leg system, you have
    and engine with multiple single points of failure. When you have multiple negative progressions
    going, you dramatically increase your chances of going broke.
