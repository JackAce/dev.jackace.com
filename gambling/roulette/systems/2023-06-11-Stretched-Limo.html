<ul>
    <li>
        Bet $5 on 5 non-overlapping Splits in two Dozens.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you win, press to 10, then 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, and 130.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are a bunch of levels to this system. Alex only got to level 3. But I think
    you get the idea. I'm not going to create images for each level.
</p>
<p>
    5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 30 -> 50 -> 70 -> 100 -> 130
</p>

    What a waste of time. You have to keep adding to your bet, so any loss is going to set
    you back further each time. You only profit if you get through the entire sequence without
    missing.

<p>
    You're just betting 20 numbers. Why not try to incorporate the High or Low bets so you're not
    stretching over the whole felt?
