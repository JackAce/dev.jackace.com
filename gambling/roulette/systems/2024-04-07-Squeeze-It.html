    Bet 5 Double Streets with $100 each. Win this bet 2x.

<p>
    After that take your $200 profit and bet 5 Double Streets
    of $40 each. Keep betting that until you lose this bet.

    This system was meant to be a "play with the casino's money" type
    system. You're supposed to win $200 and then harvest a bunch of
    $40 wins until you get whacked.
