<p>
    You bet 1 dozen and 1 column together and D'Alembert both at the same time according
    to whether you hit both bets or not.
</p>
<p>
    If you hit one bet, you win 1 unit. If you hit 2 bets, you win 4 units.
</p>
<p>
    To be honest, I'm not sure what they're doing here with their bets. After Alex won the
    70+70 bet, he reset to step 1...They originally said this system was supposed to be
    D'Alembert...
</p>
<p>
    Alex said he was up $390, but I think he was only up $200.
