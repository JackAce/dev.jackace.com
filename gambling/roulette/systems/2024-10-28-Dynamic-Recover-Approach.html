<p>
    This is a Negative Progression system. They originally had all 3 small bets in
    the 2nd Dozen, but later they moved one of the small bets into the 1st Dozen,
    to help create a mega Jackpot. You can see the giant payout on Tier 3.

    You can walk when you hit a Jackpot.

    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=2105 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=2160 -%}.

    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="c" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    I would give it a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%},
    if the progression were easier.
