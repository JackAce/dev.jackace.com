    Negative Progression
</p>
<p>
    This is a 5 leg Fibonacci Progression system. Bet $10 on each the 3 even money bets, as well as
    $10 each on a Column and a Dozen.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not going to create graphics for each scenario. Just know the even money bets pay 1:1 and the
    Dozens/Columns pay 2:1.

<p>
    I don't like multi-leg systems in general, but this one is particularly bad because you're Martingaling
    the Even money bets. When you win a pressed even money bet in Fibonacci, you don't recover your
    losses. You're still in the hole. So you're risking a TON of money trying to chase, yet you're
    still going to be down for those bets.
