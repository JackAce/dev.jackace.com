<p>
    Tier 1: Bet $5 on 15 numbers straight-up.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins, go to Tier 2: Bet $180 on a Dozen.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins, go to Tier 3: Bet $540 on an Even Money bet.
</p>
<p>
    When you lose, reset to step 1. You have 8 bullets to try to turn $75 into $1080.
</p>
<p>
    Not a bad system, but I really hate betting on 15 numbers straight-up.
