<p>
    This is supposed to be a "2 player system". That's why I'm giving it an
    {%- include ceg-system-rating.html rating="F" showRatingLetter=true %} before even
    seeing how it performs.
</p>
<p>
    It's a complete waste of time to have two players 'working together' as a team. Just
    bet the same if you want to sit together. Or better yet, just have one person bet and
    have the other person watch.
</p>
<p>
    For the 1st Dozen and 2nd Column bets, you press an additional $14 when you miss.
</p>
<p>
    I'm displaying the bets as if a single person is making them.
</p>
<p>
    The two were up $15 at the end, but I have them being up $45.
