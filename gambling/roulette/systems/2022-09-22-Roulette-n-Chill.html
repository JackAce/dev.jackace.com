<p>
    Bet $150 on an even money bet. If it wins, then bet $150 on two Dozen bets.
    If that wins, then bet $25 on 6 Streets.
</p>
<p>
    The system author claims you win $275 when you hit one of the 6 $25 streets... But
    they forgot to subtract the $125 that you lose...

    Alex lost 10 Even Money bets in a row. Brutal.
