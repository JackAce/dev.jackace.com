<p>
    Shit multi-leg system.
</p>
<p>
    The multi-leg aspect of this system means that there are TWO chanes to go broke.
</p>
<p>
    If one leg of the system is doing well, that means there's a greater probability 
    that another leg is performing poorly.
</p>
<p>
    Having to avoid TWO disasters instead of one means you're more than doubling your
    chances of going bust.
</p>
<p>
    It would be much better to bet 1 Dozen and 1 Column instead. Then the success of
    one leg doesn't greatly influence the success/failure of the other.
