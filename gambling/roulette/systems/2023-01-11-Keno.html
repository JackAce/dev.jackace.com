<p>
    There are 8 steps to this progression system:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Bet $10 on two Dozens.
    </li>
    <li>
        If that loses, bet $30 on an Even Money bet.
    </li>
    <li>
        If that loses, bet $40 on a Dozen
    </li>
    <li>
        If that loses, bet $50 on a Double Street
    </li>
    <li>
        If that loses 3 times...bet 2 $30 Splits
        ({%- include roulette-spot.html number="16" -%}-
        {%- include roulette-spot.html number="19" %}
        and
        {% include roulette-spot.html number="18" -%}-
        {%- include roulette-spot.html number="21" %}
        suggested)
        or you can bet a $60 corner bet.
    </li>
    <li>
        If that loses 3 times, bet $70 on a Street.
    </li>
    <li>
        If that loses 3 times, $80 on a Split.
    </li>
    <li>
        If that loses 3 times, $90 on a number Straight up.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    I'm not really digging this system. It just seems like you chase losses with the
    least amount of money, but at the same time, your chances of recovering become
    more and more dire.
</p>
<p>
    You'd probably hover around the small bets for a while, but then you'd spiral out
    of control.
</p>
<p>
    Not really my type of system at all.
