<p>
    This is double the stakes of
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2024-02-08-Triple-Entry-Max-Climax" %} with
    a twist on the top tier.
</p>
<p>
    To play this system, you start on the 2nd tier ($150). Drop to the 1st tier if you win 1 of the 3
    even money bets. Go to the 3rd tier if you win 2/3. Go to the 4th tier if you win 3/3.
</p>
<p>
    If you win on the 1st or 3rd tier (second spin of the bullet), then proceed to the 4th tier.
</p>
<p>
    On the 4th tier, whether you win or lose, reset to the 2nd tier, unless you hit your goal.
</p>
<p>
    There are 3 ways to get to the 4th tier...Hence triple entry.

<p>
    <b>FOR TIER 4:</b> You just take $150 and sprinkle it around the table on straight-up bets. Alex was
    betting between $5 and $20 on a bunch of numbers, so it's a fluid betting pattern. The image used
    for this system page is just a suggestion of bets you can make.
