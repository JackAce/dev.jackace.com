<p>
    Start with Double Street Martingale. If you win $100, play with the winnings
    until you lose it. Got back to step 1.
</p>
<p>
    Second step is two $25 dozen bets.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins, 3rd step is to bet $50 on an even money bet.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins, 4th step is $80 (should it be $75???) on a bunch of numbers.
</p>
<p>
    After the 4th step, always reset to step 1.
</p>
<p>
    I would improve this system by betting more on fewer numbers on the 4th tier.
