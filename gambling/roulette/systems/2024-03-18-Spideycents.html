<p>
    Start with Double Street Martingale. If you win $100, play with the winnings
    until you lose it. Got back to step 1.
</p>
<p>
    Second step is two $25 dozen bets.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins, 3rd step is to bet $50 on an even money bet.
</p>
<p>
    If that wins, 4th step is $80 (should it be $75???) on a bunch of numbers.
</p>
<p>
    After the 4th step, always reset to step 1.
</p>
<p>
    I really don't like this system. It just doesn't make sense. I get that you're
    supposed to win $100 off the bat and then try to springboard that into a big win...
    But I just don't understand the betting levels that you're supposed to make. Why
    are the bet sizes the amounts that they are?
