title: Columns and Dozens Slow Grind - Roulette System Review

<p>
    Watch two blank spins. Bet $5 each on the last 2 dozens that hit.
</p>
<p>
    When you lose, increment your bet from $5x2 to $20x2 to $75x2 to $250x2.
</p>
<p>
    When you win, switch from dozens to columns then back.

<p>
    There's a discrepancy with Friend 2's final result.
</p>
<p>
    Man, fuck this system. The bet sizes make no sense. Column to Dozen
    switching does nothing. Waiting on blank spins is a waste of time.
