    I don't really have a problem with this system, but I would just consolidate the bets into
    a $60 Dozen bet plus a $15 Street bet. Making 11 separate bets is just a waste of time.

    It's somewhat strange that they could give this system a C rating when they just got
    whacked 6 times... They didn't even get to really demonstrate how the system works when
    you parlay the win.

    It's a decent progression system. I just have objections to all the small bets. I would
    much rather consolidate the bets to make it DTF friendly.
