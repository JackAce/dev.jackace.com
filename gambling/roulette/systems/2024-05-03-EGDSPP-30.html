<p>
    Positive progression system.
    This is a tweak of the

    system. Keep pressing the winnings onto the 4
    extensible Double Street bets.

    Another crappy system. I don't even like the original, so I don't know
    why variants keep popping up. It just seems like you're never at a point
    where you can take a loss. You just keep pressing and hope that you avoid
    the enevitable whack.
