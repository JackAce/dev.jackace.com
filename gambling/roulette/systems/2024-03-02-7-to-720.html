    Bet $80 on Romanovsky until you're up $40.

    This system was a mess. They didn't really stick to the original strategy and there were just too
    many steps to have to keep track of. And since they didn't really progress, they couldn't bet all
    the tiers.

    Alex bought in for more after losing his original $320 (another $200?)
