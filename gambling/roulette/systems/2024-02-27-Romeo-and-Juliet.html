<p>
    This is a bullshit "couple's system". It's basically betting 5 corners at a time with
    2 legs. If your leg misses, then double the bet for that leg.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not going to provide all the possible permutations for bets for this system. It's
    just too many different combinations. This system is just awful, so it doesn't matter.
</p>
<p>
    If you're going to use a multi-leg system, you should try to ensure that the different
    legs are MOSTLY independent of each other. With this system, there's a huge overlap where
    if 1 leg is doing well, then the other leg is probably doing poorly.
