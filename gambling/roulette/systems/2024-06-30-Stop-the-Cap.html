   On tier 1, if you hit one of the Double Streets, you win $50. Take that $50 and bet
   $5 on 10 numbers straight up.

<p>
    If you hit the 16, 18, 19, or 21, you win $125 and you'll bet $10 on 10 numbers straight up.
</p>
<p>
    If you hit the 17 or 20, you win $350 and you'll bet $25 on 10 numbers straight up.
</p>
<p>
    After the $50, $100, or $250 bet, reset back to tier 1.

    Alex was up $565 at the end...but I'm not sure how. The totals are way off.
