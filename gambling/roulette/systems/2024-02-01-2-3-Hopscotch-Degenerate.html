    Horrible betting pattern. Can be cleaned up several ways.

    Fibonacci the column bets when you lose.
</p>
<p> 
    Alex changed the system mid-way, so their results were a little skewed. I really don't like all the
    senseless bets (see simpler alternative versions below). But I also think multi-leg Fibonacci is
    an exercise in futility. There are too many ways to go broke, especially on dependent legs (two columns or
    two dozens)

    I have Alex being down $15, but he was down $20 at the end for some reason.
