title: All Comp No Nuts 2.0 ðŸš«ðŸ¥œ - Roulette System Review

<p>
    A.K.A. All Comp, No Nuts with a Soul G-Spot
</p>

    I will acknowledge that Alex had an unusually bad run for this system, but it really goes to show you how
    all "comp" systems have their Achilles heels. This system only has 4 WHACKS and we managed to get WHACKED 4
    times.

    You should <b>NEVER</b> "Play for Comps". Just play at a level that you feel comfortable playing and get comps
    back as a discount to your expected loss. If you only play to try to win comps, you're going to be very likely
    under water much more than any comp value you will receive. Typically, you only make back around 20% in comps
    compared to your expected loss.
