    Here are some tips for getting your system reviewed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Come up with a good name
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't make the system overly complicated
    </li>
    <li>
        Be <i>EXTREMELY</i> detailed with your rules from switching from one
        betting level to the next. 99% of the time I don't review a system is
        because I don't understand how to jump from one bet to the next.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include screenshots from the Roulette Bet Analyzer. The bets and the Win/Loss section
        should be supplied.
    </li>
</ul>

    Here are some more general tips for getting your system reviewed:

    Even though the above video is for CEG submissions, there's a lot of overlap with
    my criteria.
