<p>
    After winning 3 rounds of Romanovsky ($20 each), bet $20 on a single Dozen. Do
    3 attempts to hit. If one of those attempts hits, then bet $30 on two numbers
    straight-up.

    I really couldn't figure out this system...Between CEG's description of it and the
    actual implementation, I was pretty lost. This is why I'm giving it a "D".
