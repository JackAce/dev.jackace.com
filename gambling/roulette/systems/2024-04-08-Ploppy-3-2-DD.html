    Start with a $30 bet on an even money bet, $20 on a column. Increase your bet when you lose
    using a $15 unit size on the even money bet, and $10 unit size on the column bet. Use D'Alembert
    to move up or down with the LARGE win (win both bets) as the factor for moving back down.

    This is a dumb system. Way too complicated and there's no real way to get out of the hole you're going
    to dig when you lose.
