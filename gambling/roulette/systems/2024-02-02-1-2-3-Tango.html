<p> 
    Positive Progression system - Bet $25 on a Dozen. If that wins, bet $25 each on 2 Dozens.
    If that wins, bet $25 on a single column and $25 each on two corner bets that overlap on
    that column. If that bet wins up the middle, bet $25 on one column, one dozen and $10 on
    a number in the middle column straight-up and $10 on each of the 4 splits containing that
    same number.
