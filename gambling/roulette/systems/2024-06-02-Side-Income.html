<p>
    Start with a $10 bet ($5 on two dozens). This is apparently the only time you bet this.
</p>
<p>
    After EVERY win, bet a single $5 bet on a dozen.
</p>
<p>
    After a loss, bet the $60x2 then the $400+$400+$200 bets.
</p>
<p>
    So the negative progression is $5 -> $120 -> $1000...which is insane.
