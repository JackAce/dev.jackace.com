<p>
    Parlay a $5 dozens bet two times, and after winning the 3rd one, pocket $100 of it and bet the remaining $35 on
    any number straight-up.

    This is a good simple system. Bet a little with a chance of hitting big. Plus, you take $100 of profit on Tier 3,
    so you don't always have to hit the Tier 4 bet to walk away a winner.
