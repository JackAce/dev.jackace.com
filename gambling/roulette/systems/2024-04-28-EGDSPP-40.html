title: EGDSPP 4.0 - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    Positive Progression system. Walk when you're up $570(?).
    This is a tweak of the 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-12-18-EGDSPP" %}
    system.
</p>
<p>
    This system is horrible. I don't even know what's going on. The bets
    seem all over the place and there's not a real opportunity to win
    anything significant.

<p>
    I almost gave this crap an F.
</p>
<p>
    There were major discrepancies with Alex's results 
    ({%- include win-loss-amount.html amount=-50 -%}) and what I recorded from
    his spins
    ({%- include win-loss-amount.html amount=110 -%}). I'm not sure what the
    source of the discrepancy is, but it's just the nature of this wacky ass
    system.
