    Bet tier 1. When that wins, go to tier 2. When tier 2 hits TWICE, go to tier 3.

    This is a rough system. I really don't like adding a positive progression on top
    of a system with such high coverage. I think it's just a recipe for disaster.
    You're hedging too much and winning too little. All the pushes are going to
    cost you because you're depending on too few numbers to hit to proceed.
