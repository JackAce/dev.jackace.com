<p>
    You need to start with 3 "blank spins".
</p>
<p>
    Put $10 on each number NOT in the 3 blank spins and NOT 0/00. You can consolidate
    to save time. My graphics assume the 3 blank spins were 1/2/3.
</p>
<p>
    When you win, you'll win $30. You're basically betting 10 of the 11 streets.
</p>
<p>
    As you win bets, remove $10 from the previous winning number. That's a $320 bet
    to win $40.
</p>
<p>
    After that 2nd bet, wait another 3 spins and avoid those with a reset to step 1... (facepalm)
</p>
<p>
    I give this system a D because it's just a bunch of waiting around, which does nothing
    with regards to improving your chances. But that might make it good for comps...if the dealer
    or pit boss is to stupid to see that you're not betting over 60% of the time.
</p>
<p>
    I don't go to the casino to sit around and watch other people bet, especially when that
    does nothing to change your EV.
