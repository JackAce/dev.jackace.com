title: 8 Bit D'Alembert ðŸ‘¾ - Roulette System Review
---

<p> 
    8 individual D'Alembert legs. When a street misses, increase by $1. When a street hits, decrease by $1(?)
</p>
<p> 
    Don't do multi-leg systems like this.
</p>
<p> 
    There's a $3 discrepancy between my numbers and Alex's. He was up $87, but I only have him up $84.
