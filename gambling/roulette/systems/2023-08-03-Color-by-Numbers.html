    Start with a blank spin. Then press on that color. Bet $50 on the column that has the <i>least</i> amount of that color.
    Bet $5 on every straight-up bet outside of that column containing that color. It should be $120 bet total.

    Too many bets for me and following the color is mostly a waste of time...If you like doing it, go ahead...It doesn't
    hurt you, but it doesn't help you, either.
