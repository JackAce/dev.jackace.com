    If the bet size is $425, I would use a buy-in of $1700 or $850.

    Alex incorrectly said he won $200 for the 2nd Dozen bets even though he actually won $250. After
    his first $250 win, Alex was handed $200 for his wins that should have been a $250 win. This affected
    his actual win by $450. He was up $875 in chips at the end, but he should have been up $1425.
