title: Fibonacci Hopscotch - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    This is Fibonacci mixed in with Hopscotch.
</p>
<p>
    If you lose on the 1st step, then Fibonacci the losses. When
    you win, proceed with Hopscotch.
</p>
<p>
    You don't Fibonacci when you're already in Hopscotch territory.
    You just reset to tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, you Fibonacci the even money bet. You don't Fibonacci
    a Dozen or Column bet.
</p>
<p>
    This is a dumb system, because Fibonacci should be used with
    dozens. It's the way you climb out of the hole. The way this
    system is written, you're just Fibonaccing the even money bet.
    That mwans you won't be ahead when you recover.
</p>
<p>
    Using this system, you're likely to keep falling deeper and
    deeper in the hole.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not going to map out all the betting levels here.
