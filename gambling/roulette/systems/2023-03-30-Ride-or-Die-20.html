title: Ride or Die 2.0 - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    This is the scaled up version of Ride or Die, with $50 units instead of $5 units. It also only has
    20 bullets instead of 50.
</p>
<p>
    For tier 4, you're supposed to bet $50 on 7 numbers, straight up. That will get around the max
    inside payout for many lower limit Roulette tables.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, Alex and David never got past tier 2 of this 4 tiered system.
</p>
<p>
    I still give this sytem a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="B" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=true -%}.
    You can buy in for more money if you need to.
