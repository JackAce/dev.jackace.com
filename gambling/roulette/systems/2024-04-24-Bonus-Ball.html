<p>
    This is mostly a flat betting system. You grind out small $25 wins until you win 4 in a row.
</p>
<p>
    Then you take that $100 and bet it on an even money bet (tier 2)
</p>
<p>
    If that wins, bet $20 on 10 numbers straight-up. You win a jackpot of $520 if you hit here.
</p>
<p>
    I gave this a low score because your coverage is spread way too thin for the first bet. You
    will get whacked too many times for this to be successful.
