    Apparently these 11 numbers are single 0, and the 5 adjacent numbers on the Double Zero wheel.
    As a rule, I pretty much give any "sector betting" system an
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="f" showRatingLetter=true -%}.

    Sector betting is a complete waste of time unless you have concrete evidence that the wheel is
    biased.

    I only provided images for the first 2 tiers of this lame system. Use your imagination
    for the rest. You just double the payouts for each tier.
