<p>
    I have Alex being down $150 at the end, but he was down $110 in the video.
    The editing on the channel has changed and made it much more difficult to track.
</p>
<p>
    Alex only had $70 at the end (down $430), but he should only have been down $210,
    according to my calculations. Not sure what the discrepancy is, besides the short payments
    of $10 each.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not going to record CEG's rating of this system, because it was rated based
    on the short payments.
