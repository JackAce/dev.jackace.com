  NOTE: This Challenge is not official yet! Consider this challenge just a first draft
  for now, until I am ready to officially announce it to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Can you (or someone you know) target a sector of a Roulette wheel? Are you willing to
  put your balls to the test? Then
  <b>WELCOME to the JackAce $20,000 Roulette Sector Challenge</b>!
</p>
<p>
  If you are able to <i>DEFINITIVELY PROVE</i> that you're able to target a sector of a
  standard Double Zero Roulette Wheel, you'll earn $20,000!
</p>

<h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
<p>
  I've been hearing for <b>YEARS</b> that there are dealers out there who have this skill.
  I have serious doubts that anyone has acquired this skill, even a veteran dealer with
  decades of experience.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, I concede that it's very possible that there's someone out there
  with this skill.
</p>
<p>
  I just don't think this is a skill you can get passively. If there's someone who can
  target sectors, they'd have to make acquiring this skill an extremely high priority
  in their daily life. I think they'd need to record video of themselves practicing
  for hundreds of hours as part of their learning process.
</p>
<p>
  And now, I'm giving anyone with this skill an amazing opportunity.
  If someone wants to step up and prove themselves, then I'm fine with losing
  the $20k I'm putting up.
</p>
<p>
  But, I think that many people underestimate how rare this ability is. I have heard many
  people argue that a person who has been dealing Roulette for 20 years will naturally
  develop this ability. They believe a dealer will develop this skill with ZERO effort
  <i>beyond</i> just working an 8 hour shift for 20 years.
</p>
<p>
  <i>I think this is bullshit.</i>
</p>
<p>
  If someone can demonstrate this skill, I think they'd have to make it a focal point of
  their career. Clocking the wheel's speed and timing your release point of the ball doesn't
  happen in a vacuum. If someone has this ability, it's because they've practiced it daily
  for <i>years</i>.
</p>
<p>
  If this person exists, I'm willing to pay $20,000 to find them. This is not about me trying
  to make money on a rigged game at the County Fair. This is more about putting this claim to
  rest (yea or nay) after hearing it for years.
</p>

<h3>What's the PROOF?</h3>
<p>
  You'd think I'd make the requirements nearly impossible to hit, but you'd be wrong. I am
  making this as simple as possible.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Just avoid 3 numbers.</i>
</p>
<p>
  That's right, you don't need to hit the same number 20 times in a row. You don't have to
  hit the same half of the wheel 100 times in a row. All you have to do is keep the ball from
  landing on 3 numbers.
</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>
<p>
  Obviously, I'm not going to have you do just one attempt. In order to win the $20,000, you
  will need to perform 228 spins. And if you hit one of those three numbers in one of the 228
  attempts, you lose the challenge.
</p>
<p>
  The challenge will be performed at a TBD location with a casino-comparable Roulette Wheel
  and table.
</p>
<p>
  There will also be requirements for the wheel's RPM and spin direction, the ball launch,
  and an overall time limit to the challenge. The dealer will also have to adhere to most
  standard casino procedures when performing the challenge.
</p>
<p>
  The challenge will be filmed for various social media publishing (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram,
  etc.), but the challenger may have the option to use a pseudonym and/or their face to be
  blurred out. If the challenger's face is blurred, the prize pool will be reduced.
</p>

<h3>Entry Fee</h3>
<p>
  It would be impossible for me to open this opportunity to the public. I don't want people
  lining up around the block hoping to get lucky and win the $20k. For this reason, I feel
  the need to require an "entry fee".
</p>
<p>
  For that reason, I'm requiring a $5k REFUNDABLE Entry Fee for anyone wishing to attempt
  the feat. A significant amount of that fee will go towards expenses, including table rental
  and venue costs.
</p>
<p>
  If the challenge is won, however, the entry fee will be refunded and the winner will get the
  prize money minus the above expenses.
</p>

<h3>More Details</h3>
<p>
  
</p>

<h3>Semi-Official Rules</h3>
<p>
  There will be an official contract signed for this challenge, but most of the finer details can
  be found in this section.
</p>

<h4>Date and Location of Challenge</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The challenger and I will agree to a date and location of the challenge. The location will either
    be in Southern California (LA/Orange County area) or in Las Vegas.
  </li>
  <li>
    The event will take place at a rented facility using a rented Roulette wheel and table or at a
    dealer's school using their equipment.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Roulette wheel will be of casino-comparable quality and will be agreed upon before any contact is
    signed. The challenger and I will have a chance to inspect the equipment over Zoom (or another video
    conferencing software platform) beforehand.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Challenge Time</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    From start to finish, the challenger will have 4 hours to complete the entire challenge. It is possible
    to "stop the clock" for restroom breaks as well as wheel calibration checks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stopping the clock may only be done only 5 times for the purpose of restroom and vaping and other
    comfort-related reasons. These breaks may not be longer than 10 minutes each.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stopping the clock may occur if I believe the wheel RPM requirement isn't being met. The wheel speed should
    be immediately corrected before the next qualified spin is recorded.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Wheel Speed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The wheel is required to spin at a minimum of 10 RPM (1 revolution every 6 seconds). We may occasionally
    pause the clock to perform a speed check if we believe the wheel is not spinning fast enough.
  </li>
  <li>
    The clock can only be paused to ensure that it is going at the correct speed. Once it is up-to-speed, all
    registered spins will count until it is paused again or the spin count has been met.
  </li>
  <li>
    The wheel may be spun either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Ball Launch</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The ball must be launched according to standard casino procedure.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ball must be launched in the opposite direction of the spinning wheel. If the wheel is spinning
    clockwise, the ball must be launched counter-clockwise. If the wheel is spinning counter-clockwise,
    the ball must be launched clockwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ball must spin around the wheel (using the release point as the reference point) at least 4 times
    before dropping. Dropping means falling below the "fret-line" of raised diamonds around the wheel. If
    the ball does not satisfy this requirement, then the spin will NOT count as an official spin.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>To Watch or NOT to Watch?</h4>
<p>
  According to most casino standard procedure, the dealer is <i>NOT</i> allowed to look at the wheel
  when the ball is propelled. In order to protect the game from potential cheaters and to lower the
  possibility of a dealer targeting sectors of the wheel, the dealer is usually instructed to look
  at the betting layout as the ball is being launched. They are not supposed to have their head turned
  toward the wheel.
</p>
<p>
  In this challenge, I'm giving the dealer an option, though.
</p>
<p>
  The challenger has the option of <i>CHOOSING</i> whether they want to be
  allowed to look at the wheel as the ball is launched.
</p>
<p>
  If the challenger chooses to NOT watch, they are allowed to land in the chosen section up to 2 times
  and they will STILL win the challenge. If they choose to watch the wheel and hit the chosen section
  exactly 3 times after all spins are complete then it will be considered a DRAW. On the 4th hit of the
  section, the challenge will be lost and all Entry fees will be lost.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the challenger CHOOSES to look at the wheel, they may not hit the chosen section of 3 numbers
    <b>at all</b>. If they hit the chosen section, the challenge is over and the entry fee will be
    lost.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the challenger chooses to NOT look at the wheel, they may hit the chosen section up to 2 times. If the
    challenger completes ALL required spins and hits the chosen section EXACTLY 3 times, then the event
    will be considered a draw and the challenger will not lose their entry fee. I will cover all expenses
    out-of-pocket. If the challenger hits the chosen section 4 times, then the challenge will be over
    and the entirety of the Entry Fee will be lost.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the challenger chooses to NOT look at the wheel, they may not directly look at the wheel when the
    ball is launched. They should look at the betting layout, which is standard procedure for dealers
    at most casinos.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the challenger chooses to NOT look at the wheel, if they are caught facing the wheel when the ball
    is launched, the spin will not count.
  </li>
</ul>
